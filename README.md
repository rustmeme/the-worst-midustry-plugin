# the-worst-mindustry-plugin (copied by 0==(=======>#0450 for trying to fix some bugs)

This is yet another rewrite of a plugin for TWS server. This time around though, I decided to 
write it in kotlin. It turned out to be the best decision I ever made. 

## setup

Plugin is now using postgres sql so in order to use it you have to have it installed. When server 
is first run, it will probably crash due to invalid password. You have to go to a config that 
gets created automatically. Config file should look similar to this.
```json
{
  "database" : "mtest", 
  "password" : "helloThere", 
  "user" : "postgres"
}
```
Important things you have to set are user and password. Set them to values with which you log into postgres
console. If you installed postgres correctly and when by an instructions on their website, after typing `psql`
in your command prompt, postgres should ask you for a password and this exact password has to be put to the 
config. Once you opened the console, you have to use `create database <db_name>;` to create a database with a 
name you desire. This same name then has to be put inside `database field in config`.

Now you should be able to launch server with no errors.

# documentation

## worst/config.json

```json
{
  "configPaths": {},
  "disabledGameCommands": [],
  "doubleTapSensitivity": 300,
  "gamemode": "survival",
  "inspectHistorySize": 5,
  "maturity": 18000000,
  "minBuildCost": 60.0,
  "testPenalty": 900000,
  "vpnApyKey": "",
  "afkPeriodInMinutes": 5,
  "censuredCommands": ["account"],
  "rateLimitFreeCommands": ["test"]
}
```

The generic config file. Here you can specify config path map. Just specify the configuration name and map it to 
desired path so servers can share a common config. To see the list of configurable items use `configure` command.
`vpnApyKey` is backed by https://vpnapi.io so get the key here. If apy key is empty, you have only 100 checks per 
day. With the key you have 1000 which for most cases is enough.

## worst/databaseDriver/config.json

Config defines behavior of the database.

```json
{
  "database": "mtest",
  "multiplier": {
    "built": 100,
    "commands": 0,
    "deaths": 10,
    "destroyed": 5,
    "killed": 1,
    "messages": 0,
    "playTime": 100000,
    "played": 200,
    "silence": 10000000,
    "wins": 1000
  },
  "password": "",
  "user": "postgres"
}
```

I will not explain thi in detail. Each field should make sense except multipliers. These are related to 
`points` quest in ranks. Almost all properties will multiply the value except playTime and silence. 
These are dividers.

## worst/ranks/config.json

In his file you can define the ranks for players to achieve or use as administration tool. Lets first go 
over rank structure. Here is example rank:

```json
{
  "owner": {
    "color": "#D184FF #F1F1FF #84D1FF",
    "control": "Absolute",
    "description": {
      "default": "The guy that is paying for all of this."
    },
    "displayed": true,
    "kind": "Normal",
    "permanent": true,
    "perms": ["Scream"],
    "quest": {},
    "unit": "mega",
    "value": 0,
    "voteValue": 4,
    "unitRecharge": 30000,
    "pets": ["petName"]
  }
}
```
This is an example of high order rank for tom admins. The control is absolute means that player can 
do everything that you can do trough server terminal (as far as plugin goes). There are multiple types 
of control levels: 

- `None` is for players that are banned on the server. It disallows prayer from doing anything. Only send 
  messages to chat and spectate
  
- `Paralized` is similar to none but allows player to log in with `account` command. This prevents players 
  from playing with no account.
  
- `Minimal` is for newcomers, the players that are not verified yet. Player with this permission can use most 
  of the commands, but he cannot modify blocks of players with higher permission level.
  
- `Normal` is for verified players. They can do anything that does not affect other players status.

- `High` is for admins, Main feature is `setrank` and no command rate-limits

- `Absolute` already mentioned.

Somewhat less important is `color` property which determinate the color of the rank and user message. Multiple 
colors can be combined creating gradient. You have to use hex notation and separate colors with spaces.

`description` is what shows up when you use `/ranks <rankName>`. This should describe rank purpose, some story 
or whatever, you can leave it blanc. The description supports a the_worst_one.bundle, that's why you have to write each
translation under the key. `default` key is fall back for players that are missing a translation.

`displayed` determinate whether rank should be appended to players name. This is useful for common ranks like 
newcomer or verified, which you generally don't want to show as it is spammy.

Another property is `kind`. There are only two variants, that is `Normal` for ranks that cannot be obtained by 
a quest and `Special` that can be.

`perms` denote some special permissions for a player. They mostly affect voting sessions but can also have 
other effects. Probably more to come.

- `Skip` allows a player to instantly use any command that would otherwise require vote session.

- `Scream` gives player ability to send uppercase messages.

- permissions that reduce vote session duration and make it succeed if there is more yes votes than no votes: 
  `VoteKick` = vokekick, `Maps` = maps, `Store` = loadout store, `Load` = loadout load, `BuildCore` = buildcore, 
  `Boost` = boost
  
- `quest` is most complicated property. It allows defining conditions under which player will obtain the rank, 
  if it is special. 

    - simple quests that just assert the amount of some actions are `built destroyed killed deaths played wins 
      messages commands playTime silence age rankCount rankTotalValue points`. You specify these as `"name": number`. 
      The time stamps has to be specified in milliseconds(3600000 = 1h). (`points` are calculated based of other 
      stats, and their significance which is also configured)
      
    - `ranks` specify which ranks player has to have to obtain the current one. These gets rid of repetition in 
      case you want to combine ranks.
      
    - `roles` if player have his discord account synced, this quest can set the discord role as requirement to 
      obtain the rank. Roles are continuous string where ';' are delimiters between role names.
      
    - `pointPlace` a special quest that can set position on the leader board as quest. ("pointPlace": 10 means only 
      top 10 players can obtain this rank)
      
- `unit` can be set to name of some in the_worst_one.game unit and if player uses `/spawn mount` he will turn into 
that unit. Related property is `unitRecharge` which signifies the time since dismount in milliseconds that is required 
  for a mount to be used again.
  
- `voteValue` indicates how much is players vote worth. The total vote count required is also affected by this 
  property, when player is online.
  
- `pets` defines which pets the rank owns and will spawn when player joins the the_worst_one.game.
  
## worst/bot/config.json

File contains discord bot configuration

```json
{
  "disabled": true,
  "permissions": {
    "execute": ["roleName", "otherRoleName"]
  },
  "prefix": "~",
  "token": "your bot token",
  "channels": {
    "chat": "channel id"
  }
}
```

`disabled` makes bot disabled so that plugin will not attempt to connect with a bot.

`permissions` are way to map the required roles to use commands. (`"command name": [..roles]`)

`channels` hold ides to guild channels that are used by the plugin. The options are `chat` ro bridge 
the_worst_one.game chat with discord chat and `rankLog` to log the rank changes.

## worst/buildcore/config.json

```json
{
  "costs": {
    "copper": 1
  },
  "shipTravelTime": 180
}
```
`costs` specify resources needed to build the core.

`shipTravelTime` for how long it takes to deliver the core in seconds.

## worst/boost/config.json

```json
{
  "buildSpeed": {
    "cost": {
      "copper": 1
    },
    "duration": 30,
    "effects": {
      "buildSpeedMultiplier": 10000.0
    }
  }
}
```

`cost` resources required to activate the boost.

`duration` of the boost in seconds.

`effects` enumerates the boost effects on the the_worst_one.game. More precisely, it will temporarily multiply the rule value.
Mind that multiplying by zero can break the the_worst_one.game. If you want to know full list of options, add something random 
and error with options will show up.

# worst/pets/config.json

```json
{
  "somePet": {
    "acceleration": 100.0,
    "attachment": 50.0,
    "effectName": "fallSmoke",
    "friction": 0.0,
    "mating": 50.0,
    "maxSpeed": 1000.0,
    "minSpeed": 0.0
  }
}
```
 In this file you can define the pet configuration, to which you can refer in rank configuration. The property under which 
 the pet is defined is also its name. 
 
If you enter invalid `effectName` pets will not load and list of all effects will show
 up. Some effects will not work as they need unit of block as argument. 

`attachment` is how much is pet attracted to player.

`mating` is how much is pet attracted to other pets in the group.

If you specify high `minSpeed`, pet will be unable to settle down.
